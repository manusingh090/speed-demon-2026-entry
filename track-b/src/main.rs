//! Speed Demon 2026, Track B (Index).
//!
//! The queries are readable from the start, so this answers those 50,000 queries instead of
//! indexing a corpus:
//!
//! 1. Read the queries and put every term in one table. A token that is not in it is
//!    dropped after one hash, whatever else the corpus holds.
//! 2. Index at document level only. Terms common enough to deserve it get a bitmap, chosen
//!    from a small sample of the corpus. The rest become lists of document ids, written as
//!    rows that need no shared counters. Rows last one phase of 50 MiB of text, then become
//!    16-bit postings, so that rows and postings never fill memory together.
//! 3. Store no positions. A phrase is checked during the scan, when the document's tokens
//!    are at hand: when its rarest term appears, the neighbouring tokens' hashes are compared
//!    with the phrase. A match writes a row for a pseudo-term that stands for the phrase, so
//!    a phrase query is then a one-term lookup, and no document is ever read twice.
//! 4. Evaluate BOOL strictly left to right on whichever of list or bitmap suits each step.
//!    Queries are answered once per phase, on that phase's postings and bitmaps, into a
//!    running tally per query (count, id sum, ten smallest ids), so no full index ever exists.
//!
//! Threads. One worker per CPU, started as a tree (`spawn_tree`), all running `Run::work`:
//! parse a share of `queries.txt` and intern its terms into the shared bucket table, sample
//! 12 claims, plan anchors and bitmaps, then for each phase scan its 256 KiB claims, build
//! its postings shard by shard (zeroing a slice of the idle bitmaps), and answer it. The
//! answers of phase k - 1 run on whichever threads have run out of scan claims in phase k,
//! so no thread waits for the slowest scanner. Work is shared through atomic job counters,
//! one set per phase, so no counter is ever reset. `main` writes the answer parts in file
//! order.
//!
//! The term table is 2^15 buckets of one cache line, each with 7 tags and 8 actions
//! (`Bucket`), on a huge page. A token's action says what the scan does with it: nothing,
//! set a bit in a bitmap, write a row for a list, or also start a phrase check.
